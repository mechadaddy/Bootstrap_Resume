            <p style="font-size: larger;">As a manager in quick food service, I quickly recognized the significant impact that technological infrastructure could have on our operations. Implementing advanced systems for order processing, inventory management, and customer service would streamline our workflow, reduce errors, and enhance the overall dining experience. By leveraging technology, we could improve efficiency, cut costs, and provide a smoother, faster service to our customers, ultimately boosting satisfaction and loyalty. The integration of these technologies is crucial for staying competitive in the fast-paced food service industry.</p>

                I have extensive experience in the food service and hospitality industry. Currently, I am the General Manager at Domino's in Springfield, MO, where I have been since March 2021. In this role, I manage a team of 30 employees, implement new policies and procedures to improve efficiency, maintain staffing levels, manage and train new hires, monitor budgets, and ensure operational excellence, which has increased store profitability. Previously, I served as an Assistant Manager at the same Domino's location from May 2019, where I placed bi-weekly food orders, made the weekly schedule, established and met company goals, supervised and trained management staff, completed P&L summaries, drove sales through customer engagement, trained new teams, ensured proper staffing and organization of shifts, and conducted opening and closing duties. Additionally, since October 2018, I have worked as a Guest Services Representative at Aimbridge Hospitality in Springfield, MO, where I applied creative solutions to new issues, greeted and checked-in guests, managed and resolved conflicts, and communicated inter-departmentally to ensure guest satisfaction.</p>
